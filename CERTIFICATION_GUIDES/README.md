## 📁 How to Use This Folder

Each checklist uses the following conventions:

- ✅ = Topic complete (linked to a `.md` file in your repo)
- 🔲 = To be written (linked to intended future file path)
- Each section is **collapsible** to make browsing easier
- Topics are grouped logically per the official AWS exam guides
- Paths are **relative**, so all links work naturally on GitHub

## 🛠 Want to Extend This?

You can easily add:

- ✅ A certification-specific index (e.g., `SAP.md`) with rationale and study order
- 🧭 A `TOPICS_BY_SERVICE.md` index if you want to group everything by AWS service instead of by exam
- 📊 A visual GitHub Project board to track checklist status
