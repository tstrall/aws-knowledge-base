# AWS Certification Study Strategy

This file outlines a repeatable process for preparing for AWS certification exams in parallel with building and reviewing a personal AWS knowledge base.

It’s designed to promote **long-term retention**, not just short-term memorization — using **active learning, test feedback, and content refinement**.

## Step 1: Use Practice Exams as a Compass

Start by taking a **timed practice exam** or a set of exam-like questions.  
For each question:

1. If you got it right, move on.  
2. If you missed it or guessed:
   - Pause before reading the full answer.
   - Try to find the answer in your knowledge base (`.md` files).
   - If it's missing or unclear, add it or improve the existing entry.

This builds contextual memory and reinforces the habit of connecting real-world reasoning to your notes.

## Step 2: Maintain a Test Review Log

Log any missed or fuzzy questions in [`TEST_REVIEW.md`](./TEST_REVIEW.md) with:

- A brief summary of what confused you
- A link to the `.md` file that covers (or should cover) it
- A follow-up action (e.g., re-read, write diagram, update notes)

This file becomes your **targeted re-review list**.

## Step 3: Use Descriptive Checklists for Review

Each cert has a checklist (e.g., [`CHECKLIST_SAA.md`](./CHECKLIST_SAA.md)) that:

- Tracks what topics are written
- Links to content for easy navigation
- Includes a short description for scanning
- Can include optional review flags like:

```markdown
| Complete | Topic | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| [x] | [S3](../storage/s3.md) | Object storage (review storage classes) |
```
