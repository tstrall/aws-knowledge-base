# AWS Certification Test Review Log

This page helps you track topics that came up in practice tests, real exams, or mock interviews â€” especially those that were:

- Unclear or missed  
- Memorized but not truly understood  
- Worth reviewing again before test day  

Use it to focus your study time where it counts.
