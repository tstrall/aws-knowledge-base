# 🗺️ AWS Knowledge Base – Project Roadmap

This roadmap tracks the goals, structure, and ongoing development of this knowledge base.

It is designed to:

- 📚 Support real-world AWS architecture decisions
- 🧠 Serve as a durable study companion for AWS certifications
- 🚀 Evolve into a high-quality open reference, not just exam cram notes

---

## ✅ Completed

- ✅ Knowledge base structure defined by service area (e.g., `networking/`, `security/`, etc.)
- ✅ Markdown format finalized (concise, practical, no fluff)
- ✅ Study strategy defined: [STUDY_STRATEGY.md](CERTIFICATION_GUIDES/STUDY_STRATEGY.md)
- ✅ Test review system in place: [TEST_REVIEW.md](CERTIFICATION_GUIDES/TEST_REVIEW.md)
- ✅ Personal logging enabled: [STUDY_LOG.md](CERTIFICATION_GUIDES/STUDY_LOG.md)
- ✅ All 5 certification checklists created:
  - [SAA](CERTIFICATION_GUIDES/CHECKLIST_SAA.md)
  - [SAP](CERTIFICATION_GUIDES/CHECKLIST_SAP.md)
  - [Developer](CERTIFICATION_GUIDES/CHECKLIST_DEV.md)
  - [ML Associate](CERTIFICATION_GUIDES/CHECKLIST_ML-Associate.md)
  - [ML Specialty](CERTIFICATION_GUIDES/CHECKLIST_ML-Specialty.md)
- ✅ All checklists updated with 3-column format (✅/🔲, link, description)
- ✅ Service pages standardized with intro, use case, related services, and cert relevance

## 🔧 In Progress

- 🔄 Reviewing all written `.md` entries for accuracy and clarity
- 🔄 Updating topic entries after missed practice questions (see `TEST_REVIEW.md`)
- 🔄 Planning diagrams, decision trees, or comparisons for complex topics (e.g., storage types, messaging systems)
- 🔄 Exploring best ways to study while balancing real understanding and test performance

---

## 📌 Planned

- [ ] Write missing service pages linked in the checklists
- [ ] Build service-to-cert index (cross-reference: "where does S3 appear?")
- [ ] Add architecture pattern pages (e.g., event-driven, batch, hybrid, multi-account)
- [ ] Create visual diagrams using draw.io or PlantUML and embed in `.md` files
- [ ] Add “exam tips” section to the end of each checklist
- [ ] Publish public GitHub repo (when ready)
- [ ] Optional: create printable version of the knowledge base

## 💡 Long-Term Vision

This project will:

- Help prepare for **5 AWS certifications**
- Serve as a **professional reference** for designing secure, scalable systems
- Demonstrate **deep AWS understanding** through structured, self-authored content
- Stay fun, clean, and useful — with no pressure to rush
