## What is it?

**AWS Glue** is a fully managed, serverless data integration service that simplifies the process of discovering, preparing, moving, and integrating data from various sources. It enables users to build scalable and cost-effective extract, transform, and load (ETL) pipelines for analytics, machine learning, and application development. citeturn0search0
