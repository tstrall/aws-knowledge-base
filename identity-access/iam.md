## What is it?

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is the core service for managing **who can do what in your AWS environment**. It lets you define:

- **Users**: for individual human access
- **Roles**: for machines, services, and federated users
- **Groups**: to manage permissions in bulk
- **Policies**: documents that define whatâ€™s allowed or denied

IAM controls access to **every AWS resource**.

---

## Why should I care?

IAM is **foundational to security and architecture** in AWS. Everything else relies on it.

IAM lets you:

- Grant or restrict access to AWS services
- Assign least privilege to users and workloads
- Securely delegate access between services (e.g., Lambda assuming a role)
- Enable cross-account access
- Support identity federation (e.g., corporate SSO via IAM Identity Center)

---

## When to use it

Always. IAM is not optional.

Use it to:

- Define **fine-grained permissions** for services and actions
- Assign temporary, scoped credentials to applications or users
- **Audit access** using CloudTrail
- Manage **multi-account access** using roles and trust relationships
