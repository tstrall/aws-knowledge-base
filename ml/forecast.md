## What is it?

**Amazon Forecast** is a fully managed service that uses machine learning to deliver highly accurate time-series forecasts. It automates the complex process of building, training, and deploying forecasting models, making it accessible to developers without requiring deep ML expertise. Forecast can ingest historical time-series data along with related datasets to predict future values such as product demand, resource utilization, or financial metrics.

## Why should I care?

- **Automated ML**: Eliminates the need to build custom forecasting models from scratch.
- **High Accuracy**: Leverages advanced algorithms, including deep learning, to improve forecast precision.
- **Scalable**: Handles large volumes of data and can generate forecasts for thousands of items simultaneously.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with other AWS services like S3, SageMaker, and QuickSight.

---

## When to use it

- Predicting future product demand to optimize inventory levels.
- Forecasting resource requirements such as staffing or server capacity.
- Anticipating financial metrics like revenue or expenses.
- Planning for supply chain and logistics operations.

---

## Key features

- **AutoPredictor**: Automatically selects the best algorithm and tunes hyperparameters for your data.
- **Related Time Series and Item Metadata**: Incorporate additional datasets to enhance forecast accuracy.
- **Forecast Export**: Export forecast results to S3 for downstream analysis.
- **What-if Analysis**: Assess the impact of hypothetical scenarios on your forecasts.
- **Cold Start Forecasting**: Generate forecasts for new items with limited historical data.

---

## Common use cases

- **Retail**: Demand forecasting for products across different stores and regions.
- **Energy**: Predicting electricity consumption to manage grid resources.
- **Finance**: Forecasting cash flow, revenue, and other financial indicators.
- **Logistics**: Anticipating shipment volumes to optimize delivery routes.

---

## Integrations

- **Amazon S3**: Store and retrieve datasets and forecast outputs.
- **AWS Glue**: Prepare and transform data before importing into Forecast.
- **Amazon SageMaker**: Further analyze forecast results or build custom models.
- **Amazon QuickSight**: Visualize forecast data through interactive dashboards.
- **AWS Step Functions**: Automate end-to-end forecasting workflows.

## Example: Creating a Forecast with the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3)



```python
import boto3

forecast = boto3.client('forecast')

# Create a dataset group
forecast.create_dataset_group(
    DatasetGroupName='my_dataset_group',
    Domain='RETAIL',
    DatasetArns=['arn:aws:forecast:...']
)

# Create a predictor
forecast.create_predictor(
    PredictorName='my_predictor',
    ForecastHorizon=10,
    PerformAutoML=True,
    InputDataConfig={
        'DatasetGroupArn': 'arn:aws:forecast:...'
    },
    FeaturizationConfig={
        'ForecastFrequency': 'D'
    }
)

# Create a forecast
forecast.create_forecast(
    ForecastName='my_forecast',
    PredictorArn='arn:aws:forecast:...'
)
```
