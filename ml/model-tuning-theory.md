## What is it?

**Model tuning** refers to the process of optimizing a machine learning model's performance by adjusting its hyperparameters. Hyperparameters are configuration settings used to control the learning process and model architecture, such as learning rate, number of layers, or regularization parameters. Unlike model parameters, which are learned during training, hyperparameters are set prior to the training process and significantly influence the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

## Key Concepts

### Hyperparameters

Hyperparameters are settings that define the model structure and training process. Examples include:

- **Learning Rate**: Controls how much the model weights are updated during training.
- **Batch Size**: Number of training samples used in one iteration.
- **Number of Epochs**: Number of times the entire training dataset is passed through the model.
- **Regularization Parameters**: Prevent overfitting by penalizing complex models.

### Tuning Strategies

- **Manual Search**: Based on experience and trial-and-error.
- **Grid Search**: Exhaustive search over specified parameter values.
- **Random Search**: Randomly samples hyperparameter combinations.
- **Bayesian Optimization**: Uses probabilistic models to predict performance.
- **Population-Based Training (PBT)**: Combines hyperparameter optimization and model training by evolving a population of models.
