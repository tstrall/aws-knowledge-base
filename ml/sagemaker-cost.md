## What is it?

Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed machine learning (ML) service that enables developers and data scientists to build, train, and deploy ML models at scale. While SageMaker offers a range of features to accelerate ML workflows, it's essential to implement cost optimization strategies to manage expenses effectively. By leveraging various tools and best practices, you can minimize costs without compromising performance.

## Key Strategies for Cost Optimization

### 1. Utilize Spot Instances for Training

Leverage Amazon EC2 Spot Instances for training jobs to achieve significant cost savings. Spot Instances can reduce training costs by up to 90% compared to On-Demand Instances. SageMaker manages interruptions and checkpoints to ensure training progress is preserved. citeturn0search7

### 2. Implement Auto Scaling for Endpoints

Configure auto scaling for inference endpoints to adjust the number of instances based on traffic patterns. This approach ensures optimal performance during peak times and cost savings during low-traffic periods. citeturn0search1

### 3. Choose the Right Inference Option

Select the appropriate inference option based on workload requirements:

- **Real-Time Inference**: For low-latency, high-throughput applications.
- **Serverless Inference**: Ideal for intermittent workloads with unpredictable traffic.
- **Asynchronous Inference**: Suitable for large payloads and long processing times.
- **Batch Transform**: Best for processing large datasets offline.

### 4. Use Multi-Model Endpoints

Deploy multiple models on a single endpoint to share resources and reduce hosting costs. This approach is effective when models are infrequently invoked or have similar resource requirements. citeturn0search1

### 5. Monitor and Analyze Costs

Utilize AWS Cost Explorer and AWS Budgets to track and analyze SageMaker expenses. Implement cost allocation tags to categorize resources and gain granular insights into spending patterns. citeturn0search0

### 6. Optimize Notebook Usage

Shut down idle notebook instances to avoid unnecessary charges. Implement lifecycle configurations or automation scripts to stop notebooks during non-working hours. citeturn0search7

### 7. Leverage SageMaker Savings Plans

Commit to a consistent amount of usage over a one- or three-year term to receive discounted rates on SageMaker services. Savings Plans can reduce costs by up to 64% and apply to various SageMaker components. citeturn0search1
