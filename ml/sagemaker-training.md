## What is it?

**Amazon SageMaker Training** is a fully managed service that enables you to efficiently train machine learning (ML) models at scale without the need to manage infrastructure. It supports various training options, including built-in algorithms, custom training scripts, and pre-built Docker containers, allowing flexibility to suit different ML development needs. SageMaker Training handles provisioning of compute resources, manages data input/output, and stores the resulting model artifacts.

## Example: Launching a Training Job with the SageMaker Python SDK


```python
import sagemaker
from sagemaker import get_execution_role
from sagemaker.estimator import Estimator

# Define the IAM role
role = get_execution_role()

# Specify the container image URI for the training algorithm
image_uri = '123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/my-custom-image:latest'

# Create an Estimator object
estimator = Estimator(
    image_uri=image_uri,
    role=role,
    instance_count=1,
    instance_type='ml.m5.large',
    output_path='s3://my-bucket/output'
)

# Start the training job
estimator.fit({'training': 's3://my-bucket/training-data'})
```
