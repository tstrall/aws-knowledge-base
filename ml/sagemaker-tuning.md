## What is it?

**Amazon SageMaker Hyperparameter Tuning**, also known as Automatic Model Tuning (AMT), is a managed service that automates the process of finding the optimal set of hyperparameters for your machine learning models. By running multiple training jobs with different hyperparameter combinations, SageMaker identifies the configuration that yields the best model performance based on a specified objective metric. citeturn0search1

## Example: Launching a Hyperparameter Tuning Job with the SageMaker Python SDK


```python
from sagemaker.tuner import HyperparameterTuner, ContinuousParameter
from sagemaker.estimator import Estimator

# Define the estimator
estimator = Estimator(
    image_uri='your-training-image-uri',
    role='your-sagemaker-execution-role',
    instance_count=1,
    instance_type='ml.m5.xlarge',
    output_path='s3://your-bucket/output'
)

# Define hyperparameter ranges
hyperparameter_ranges = {
    'learning_rate': ContinuousParameter(0.01, 0.2),
    'batch_size': ContinuousParameter(32, 256)
}

# Create the HyperparameterTuner
tuner = HyperparameterTuner(
    estimator=estimator,
    objective_metric_name='validation:accuracy',
    hyperparameter_ranges=hyperparameter_ranges,
    max_jobs=20,
    max_parallel_jobs=3,
    strategy='Bayesian'
)

# Start the tuning job
tuner.fit({'training': 's3://your-bucket/training-data'})
```
