## What is it?

Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is the foundational networking layer in AWS.  
It lets you **provision a logically isolated network** within the AWS cloud, where you can launch AWS resources like EC2 instances, RDS databases, and Lambda functions â€” all with full control over IP ranges, subnets, routing, and firewall rules.

A VPC is like your **own private data center inside AWS**.

## Why should I care?

Almost every AWS architecture â€” even serverless â€” touches a VPC.  
You need to understand VPCs to:

- Control **network-level access** to your services
- Connect **securely to the internet or your on-prem network**
- Deploy resources in **public vs private subnets**
- Use security groups and network ACLs for **firewall-like protection**

Itâ€™s also the key to **multi-tier architectures**, **hybrid connectivity**, and **VPC peering** between apps.

## When to use it

Always â€” VPCs are the **default networking environment** in AWS.

Use your knowledge of VPCs when:

- Deciding **where to place** EC2, RDS, Lambda, etc.
- Designing **private/public subnet separation**
- Setting up **NAT gateways** for outbound internet access
- Connecting to on-prem using VPN or Direct Connect
- Enabling secure, isolated environments for dev/test/prod

| Service | How it connects |
|---------|------------------|
| **EC2, RDS, Lambda, ECS** | Deployed inside a VPC |
| **Security Groups / NACLs** | Act as firewalls for instances and subnets |
| **NAT Gateway / Internet Gateway** | Control internet access from inside the VPC |
| **VPC Peering / Transit Gateway** | Allow cross-VPC communication |
| **AWS PrivateLink** | Secure access to services without using public IPs |
| **Route Tables / Subnets** | Core building blocks of VPC routing logic |
