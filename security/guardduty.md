## What is it?

Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that continuously monitors AWS accounts and workloads for malicious or unauthorized behavior. It uses machine learning, anomaly detection, and threat intelligence to detect suspicious activity across your AWS environment.

Itâ€™s a foundational service for **security operations and incident response**.

---

## Why should I care?

GuardDuty helps you identify:

- Unauthorized access to your resources (e.g., credential compromise)
- Unusual API calls (e.g., disabling CloudTrail)
- Unexpected network activity (e.g., port scanning, crypto mining)
- Behavior patterns indicating a possible account breach

And itâ€™s **fully managed**, so you donâ€™t have to deploy or maintain agents or infrastructure.

---

## When to use it

Use GuardDuty when:

- You want continuous threat monitoring without building a SIEM
- You're responsible for cloud security, governance, or auditing
- Youâ€™re subject to regulatory compliance or security best practices
- You manage multiple AWS accounts (supports delegated admin)

Itâ€™s especially useful when integrated with AWS Organizations and Security Hub.
