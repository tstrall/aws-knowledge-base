## What is it?

AWS Key Management Service (KMS) is a fully managed service that enables you to create and control the cryptographic keys used to protect your data across AWS services and custom applications.

It supports **symmetric and asymmetric encryption**, **automatic key rotation**, and integration with **most AWS services**.

---

## Why should I care?

KMS is at the heart of AWS encryption. It lets you:

- Secure S3, EBS, RDS, DynamoDB, and Lambda data at rest
- Encrypt data directly using the KMS API or AWS SDK
- Automatically rotate keys and manage access
- Meet compliance standards (HIPAA, GDPR, PCI, etc.)

Youâ€™ll see KMS **everywhere** â€” if you encrypt data in AWS, itâ€™s likely using KMS under the hood.

## When to use it

Use KMS when:

- You're storing **sensitive or regulated data**
- You want to control **who can decrypt or manage** a resource
- You need centralized key lifecycle management
- You want to encrypt data before storing it (client-side or server-side)
