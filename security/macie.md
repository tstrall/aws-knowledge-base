## What is it?

Amazon Macie is a fully managed data security and privacy service that uses machine learning and pattern matching to discover and protect sensitive data in Amazon S3 buckets. Itâ€™s especially useful for identifying personal data such as PII (e.g., names, addresses, credit card numbers).

---

## Why should I care?

If you're storing **sensitive or regulated data** in S3, Macie can help you:

- Automatically identify unencrypted or publicly accessible data
- Detect PII and other sensitive information at scale
- Stay ahead of compliance audits (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.)
- Monitor for new buckets and data drift over time

It helps reduce your **attack surface** and **regulatory risk** without needing to manually inspect every file.

---

## When to use it

Use Macie when:

- You manage large or dynamic sets of S3 data
- You need to identify where sensitive data is located across your buckets
- You want automated data classification to support compliance or auditing
- You're building a data governance program and want visibility into who can access what
