## What is it?

AWS Security Hub is a centralized service that aggregates and prioritizes security findings from multiple AWS services and third-party tools. It gives you a single dashboard to **view, analyze, and respond to security issues** across your AWS accounts and regions.

It automatically runs security checks based on AWS best practices (e.g., CIS benchmarks).

---

## Why should I care?

Without Security Hub, you'd have to review findings in multiple services like:

- GuardDuty (threat detection)
- Macie (sensitive data discovery)
- Inspector (vulnerability scans)
- Firewall Manager (rule enforcement)

Security Hub brings all these into one place, letting you:

- Monitor and prioritize findings in a unified view
- Enable **automated response** using EventBridge rules
- Check compliance against **security standards** (CIS, PCI DSS, etc.)
- Use **delegated admin** to manage org-wide visibility

---

## When to use it

Use Security Hub when:

- You need a **central view of security posture** across multiple AWS accounts
- You use GuardDuty, Macie, Inspector, or third-party integrations
- You're implementing security automation
- You're preparing for compliance audits or reviews
