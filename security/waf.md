## What is it?

AWS WAF is a Web Application Firewall that protects web apps from common threats like:

- SQL injection
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Bad bot traffic
- Malicious IPs or geographies

It lets you define **rules to allow, block, or monitor** (count) web requests based on conditions that you specify.

---

## Why should I care?

AWS WAF is critical for **layer 7 (application-level)** protection. It gives you:

- Fine-grained traffic control at the edge
- Mitigation of known OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Rate limiting to slow down DDoS attacks
- Integration with **CloudFront**, **API Gateway**, and **ALB**

Use it when you want to **control and inspect HTTP(S) traffic before it reaches your app**.

---

## When to use it

Use AWS WAF when:

- You're deploying public-facing APIs or websites
- You want to defend against injection, bots, or scrapers
- You need to **throttle** abusive users or IPs
- You want to apply rules **centrally** across multiple applications
