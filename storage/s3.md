## What is it?

Amazon S3 is AWSâ€™s object storage service, designed to store and retrieve **unlimited amounts of unstructured data** from anywhere on the web.  
Itâ€™s highly durable (99.999999999%) and supports versioning, lifecycle rules, encryption, and fine-grained access control.

You can store virtually anything: logs, images, backups, datasets, Lambda artifacts, and static websites.

---

## Why should I care?

S3 is **everywhere** in AWS architectures:

- Store and retrieve static content (e.g., web assets, training data)
- Serve websites or host SPAs using S3 + CloudFront
- Archive logs or backups at low cost
- Automate lifecycle management (e.g., auto-archive to Glacier)
- Trigger Lambda functions, integrate with EventBridge

And itâ€™s one of the **most commonly tested services** on every AWS cert exam.

## When to use it

Use S3 when:

- You need **scalable, highly durable storage** for objects like files, logs, media, datasets
- You're building a **data lake**, ML pipeline, or analytics workload
- You want to host a static site without servers
- You want to offload data from EC2, RDS, or DynamoDB to reduce cost
- You need versioning, fine-grained access control, or event-driven processing
